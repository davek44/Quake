Quake is a package to correct substitution sequencing errors in experiments with
deep coverage (e.g. >20X), specifically intended for Illumina sequencing reads.
Quake adopts the k-mer error correction framework, first introduced by the EULER
genome assembly package.  Unlike EULER and similar progams, Quake utilizes a
robust mixture model of erroneous and genuine k-mer distributions to determine
where errors are located and uses read quality values and learns the nucleotide
to nucleotide error rates to determine what types of errors are most likely.
This leads to more corrections and greater accuracy, especially with respect to
avoiding mis-corrections, which create false sequence unsimilar to anything in
the original genome sequence from which the read was taken.

Quake is freely available from http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/software/quake , and a
manuscript is under preparation. Instructions on how to use Quake can be found
at http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/software/quake/manual.html .  Direct questions,
concerns, and feature requests to David Kelley (dakelley@umiacs.umd.edu).

Installation prerequisites:
1. Download and install Boost: http://www.boost.org
2. Open src/Makefile and update CFLAGS to include Boost.  E.g. if you used MacPorts, it may be:
CFLAGS=-O3 -fopenmp -I/opt/local/include -I.
3. Download and install R: http://www.r-project.org
4. Download and install R VGAM library via R command install.packages("VGAM")

Both Boost and R are easily installed via an installation helper e.g. MacPorts (http://www.macports.org) for Mac, and a command such as "sudo port install boost".
